## Primary Objective

Write a function named "checkYuGiOh" that takes a number, n, as an argument, creates an array of numbers from 1 to n and replaces multiples of 2, 3, and 5 with "yu", "gi" and "oh", then returns the resulting array.

Note:

- for numbers that have multiple factors, use hyphens as separators
e.g 10 === "yu-oh", 30 === "yu-gi-oh"
- perform checks on your input and return `invalid parameter: ${parameter}` if an invalid parameter - i.e. a string that can't be converted to a number or another data type - is passed. 
Use the following cases as guides:

- checkYuGiOh(10) should return [1, "yu", "gi", "yu", "oh", "yu-gi", 7, "yu", "gi", "yu-oh"]
- checkYuGiOh("5") should return [1, "yu", "gi", "yu", "oh"]
- checkYuGiOh("fizzbuzz is meh") should return `invalid parameter: "fizzbuzz is meh"`
